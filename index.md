Can AI Tell if Food is Cooked or Raw?

When we look at food, one of the most basic distinctions we make is whether it's raw or cooked.
This is crucial for health and safety—eating raw chicken is dangerous, but eating cooked chicken is perfectly fine. For humans, this judgment is usually easy: we observe the texture, color, and even the presentation of the food.
In this project, I wanted to see if CHATGPT vision models can also make this distinction. Can they tell whether a piece of meat or fish is cooked or raw based solely on an image? If so, what cues do they use?
To test this, I collected a set of images of common foods (chicken, fish, steak, and vegetables), both raw and cooked. Then, I tasked an AI vision model with determining whether the food in each image was cooked or raw.

My goal was to answer two main questions:
  Accuracy: How well does the model classify cooked and raw foods?
  Failure cases: Under what circumstances does the model make mistakes, and why?


Here are the results:

After running four sets of experiments with different kinds of food — chicken, fish, steak, and vegetables — the AI model was able to correctly identify whether each item was raw or cooked. This was somewhat surprising: I expected at least a few mistakes, especially for borderline cases like lightly seared steak or sushi. Instead, the model consistently gave the right answer.

This suggests that modern vision models are quite good at picking up visual cues such as:
 Color changes (raw meat is usually red or pink, while cooked meat turns brown or white).
 Texture differences (shiny and translucent surfaces vs. matte and opaque).
 Context clues (a cooked dish might appear on a plate with garnish, while raw food may be on a cutting board).

Overall, these results show that the model’s understanding of food images aligns well with human perception in this particular task.
While my experiments were limited in scope, they demonstrate that current AI systems can reliably distinguish between raw and cooked foods in clear and straightforward cases.
