Can AI Tell if Food is Cooked or Raw?

When we look at food, one of the most basic distinctions we make is whether it's raw or cooked.
This is crucial for health and safetyâ€”eating raw chicken is dangerous, but eating cooked chicken is perfectly fine. For humans, this judgment is usually easy: we observe the texture, color, and even the presentation of the food.
In this project, I wanted to see if CHATGPT vision models can also make this distinction. Can they tell whether a piece of meat or fish is cooked or raw based solely on an image? If so, what cues do they use?
To test this, I collected a set of images of common foods (chicken, fish, steak, and vegetables), both raw and cooked. Then, I tasked an AI vision model with determining whether the food in each image was cooked or raw.

My goal was to answer two main questions:
  Accuracy: How well does the model classify cooked and raw foods?
  Failure cases: Under what circumstances does the model make mistakes, and why?
